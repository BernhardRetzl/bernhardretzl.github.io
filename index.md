# Research Profile

I hold a PhD from the [Medical University of Vienna](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/), where I conducted my
doctoral research under the supervision of Prof. [Christian W. Gruber](https://www.gruber-lab.com/). My academic
background and research experience have established me as an expert in pharmacology, with significant contributions to
several [peer-reviewed publications in leading journals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9HiFPRwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
My work has focused extensively on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the oxytocin, cholecystokinin,
and kappa-opioid receptors.

In addition to pharmacology, I have developed strong expertise in phytochemistry-based drug discovery. My technical
skills span a range of methodologies, including cell culture, the development of pharmacological assays,
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, including *de-novo* peptide
sequencing.

I also spent a year working in the proteomics research group [Proteomics Pirates](https://www.tuwien.at/en/tch/bioanalytics),
led by Prof. Ruth Birner-Grünberger at the [Technical University of Vienna](https://www.tuwien.at/en/).
This position equipped me with hands-on experience in proteomics experiments and
data analysis, including work with Bruker's timsTOF Pro and GC-MS instrumentation.

Beyond academia, I worked as a bioinformatician at the Austrian biotech company [Lexogen](https://www.lexogen.com/),
specializing in RNA sequencing. During this time, I gained valuable experience in professional software development 
using Python, R, Git, GitLab, Docker, SLURM, Unix, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

I am an enthusiastic bioinformatician and data scientist, actively developing novel algorithms to advance biological
data analysis. I am currently building my own website [www.protein-pattern.com](https://www.protein-pattern.com)
dedicated to the analysis of protein families — an ongoing project.
